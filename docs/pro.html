      <p>
        Note: the features on this page are only available to
        <a href='../pro.html'>patchbay pro</a> subscribers.
      </p>

      <h1>Getting a token</h1>

      <p>
        After successfully subscribing to patchbay pro, the next step is
        to get a token for your email address. This is easily done with a curl
        request. If I wanted a token for info@patchbay.pub, I would make the
        following request:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/auth?method=createToken&email=info@patchbay.pub'
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You will receive a verification email at the specified address. Once
        you click on the link in that email, the curl command will return with
        an auth token. Use that token as the value for the pb-token query
        parameter in the requests below. For the sake of example, we'll
        pretend the returned token was acgt1234.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can create additional tokens as needed. When used in patchbay
        requests, the tokens unlock the patchbay pro features.
      </p>

      <h1>Reserving a channel</h1>

      <p>
        The next step is to reserve your private channel. This can also be done
        with a curl request. As an example, assume I want to reserve the
        channel name "anders". I would make the following request:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/pro/reserve-channel?channel-name=anders&pb-token=acgt1234'
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You can now make authenticated requests to this channel. For example,
        you could host a web page like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
while true; do curl 'https://patchbay.pub/queue/anders/index.html?&pb-token=acgt1234' --data-binary @index.html; done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Only users with valid tokens can read/write to that endpoint. A common
        pattern is to make endpoints open publicly for reading, but reserve
        writing for the owner. This allows you to host public websites.
      </p>


      <h1>Permissions</h1>

      <p>
        patchbay uses a simple authorization system, based on paths. By
        default, every path is open to both reading and writing by anyone.
        Each path has 4 lists of permissions: Readers, Writers, Managers, and
        Owners. Readers can perform only GET requests. Writers can perform
        all requests. Managers can change Readers and Writers. Owners can
        change Managers. When you registered your patchbay pro account, you
        were added as an Owner over your reserved channel. This locked it
        down so that only you can control the permissions.
      </p>

      <p>
        Adding/removing permissions is very simple. As always, it can be done
        using curl, in this case via the /auth/ protocol.
      </p>

      <p>
        To add a reader:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/auth/anders?&method=addReader&email=info@patchbay.pub&pb-token=acgt1234'
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        To remove a reader:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl 'https://patchbay.pub/auth/anders?&method=removeReader&email=info@patchbay.pub&pb-token=acgt1234'
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        The pattern is exactly the same for addWriter, removeWriter,
        addManager, removeManager, addOwner, and removeOwner.
      </p>
