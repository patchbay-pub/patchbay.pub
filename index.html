      <h1>TL;DR</h1>
      <p>
        patchbay.pub is a free web service you can use to implement things like
        <a href='#static-hosting'>static site hosting</a>,
        <a href='#serverless'>dynamic site hosting</a>,
        <a href='#file-sharing'>file sharing</a>,
        <a href='#notifications'>cross-platform notifications</a>,

        smart home event routing, IoT reporting,
        <a href='#job-queues'>job queues</a>,
        <a href='#chat-systems'>chat systems</a>, bots,
        etc, all completely serverless and requiring no account creation or
        authentication. Most implementations need nothing but curl and simple
        bash snippets.
      </p>

      <h1>Why did you make this?</h1>

      <p>
        I originally wanted an easy way to get a notification on my laptop when
        a long-running job on my server completed.  After a bit of
        experimenting I decided a small amount of additional features would
        result in a more generally useful tool.  This evolved into the
        following question:
      </p>

      <p class='emphasized'>
        "What is the
        <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pareto_principle'>20%</a>
        of
        <a target='_blank' href='https://ifttt.com/'>IFTTT</a>
        functionality I could implement to have 80% of IFTTT features that I
        would personally use?"
      </p>

      <p>
        patchbay is what I ended up with.
      </p>

      <p class='emphasized'>
        The entire philosophy of patchbay is that all the logic is done on your
        local machine[s], typically with small shell snippets. The server
        exists only for you to connect
        ("<a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patch_panel'>patch</a>")
        different components together.
      </p>



      <h1>How is it implemented?</h1>

      <p>
        patchbay provides an infinite number of virtual HTTP "channels" anyone
        can use. Each channel is represented by a URL. Here's an
        example channel:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='plaintext'>
https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Generally, a channel is chosen by randomly generating a string long
        enough that no one else will guess it (all channels are publicly
        accessible; see
        <a href='#security'>Security</a>),
        and then sending HTTP requests to it. The channel above was generated
        by your browser when you loaded this page, and should be fine to use
        for running the examples. Channels don't have to be explicitly created
        before use.  Channels can operate in one or both of two modes. By
        default, a channel models a multi-producer, multi-consumer (MPMC)
        queue, where GET requests add a consumer, and POSTs add a producer.
        Consumers will block if there aren't any producers, and producers will
        block if there aren't any consumers.  As soon as a producer gets
        matched with a consumer, anything in the producer's HTTP body is
        streamed over the channel to the consumer. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Enough theory; let's try out a trivial example. If you run this GET to
        create a consumer, it will block:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Until you also run this POST in another terminal to create a producer:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span> -d "Hi there"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You can also try reversing the order, and observe that the producer
        blocks until you run the consumer. If you start 2 producers at the
        same time, you'll have to run the consumer twice in order to unblock
        both of them, one after the other.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you set the <code>pubsub=true</code> query parameter, like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true -d "Hi there"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        the request uses the channel in a different mode. GETs act similar to
        before, but POSTs become non-blocking, and will broadcast messages to
        all blocked pubsub consumers, not just the first one. As the name
        suggest, this models the
        <a target='_blank' href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern'>PubSub pattern</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, with that brief introduction, here are a few examples of things you
        can implement with MPMC queues and pubsub messages over HTTP:
      </p>



      <h2 id='notifications'>Poor man's desktop notifications</h2>

      <p>
        Here's how my original goal can be implemented using patchbay.pub.
        First, on my remote server:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
./longjob.sh; curl -X POST https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        And on my Linux laptop with
        <a target='_blank' href='https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Desktop_notifications'>desktop notifications</a>
        support:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true; notify-send "Job done"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        That's it. I'll get a popup on my screen when the job is done. (Note
        that MacOS has
        <a target='_blank' href='https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/115373'>notification functionality</a>
        built-in.) If I want to get real fancy I can re-run the consumer in a
        loop. I keep the following script running in the background ready to
        receive notifications from whatever producers I want, displaying the
        HTTP body from the producer:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
#!/bin/bash

while true
do
    # Run curl in a subshell and pass the results to notify-send
    notify-send $(curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true)

    # Avoid too many requests if server is down or rejecting
    if [ "$?" -ne "0" ]; then
        sleep 1
    fi
done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        It's also possible to use a GET request to create a producer. This is
        done by using the <code>method</code> and <code>body</code> query
        parameters, like this:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
curl "https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true&method=post&body=Job%20Done"
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        This is useful if you want to do something like send a signal from a
        mobile browser, where you only have access to the address bar. I like
        to create mobile browser shortcuts for triggering different things.
      </p>

      <h2 id='notifications'>Poor man's SMS notifications</h2>

      <p>
        Let's extend the previous example a bit. What if I want to go to lunch,
        but still get notified when the job on my server is done? The server
        is already broadcasting a pubsub message, so I don't need to make any
        changes there. I just need to add a consumer that can notify me on the
        go. How about using
        <a target='_blank' href='https://www.twilio.com/'>Twilio</a>
        to send myself a text message? First I followed
        <a target='_blank' href='https://www.twilio.com/docs/twilio-cli/quickstart'>the instructions</a>
        to get the Twilio CLI installed and logged in on my laptop, then it's
        just a matter of calling it with the body received by the pubsub
        consumer:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
twilio api:core:messages:create --from "+15017122661" --to "+15558675310" --body $(curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true)
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Now I'll get a desktop notification, <em>and</em> a text message when
        the job is done. If you don't want to pay for texts, you can do 
        something similar with any messaging app that offers an API.
      </p>


      <h2 id='webhooks'>Poor man's webhooks</h2>

      Receiving a text notification is useful, but what if I want to
      <em>send</em> a text to my Twilio number and have it trigger some other
      event? This is easily done by logging in to the Twilio website and
      pointing the SMS webhook to 
      <code>https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>?pubsub=true</code>.

      Any texts to my number will now trigger a pubsub event on the same
      channel as before. I can use whatever command line tools I want to
      process the webhook.

      <h2 id='chat-systems'>Poor man's IRC</h2>

      <p>
        How about an ad-hoc chat app? This chat includes everyone currently
        visiting this page, using the https://patchbay.pub/pubchat channel. It
        doesn't require any fancy WebRTC or WebSockets; just HTTP. It's
        implemented using the
        <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events/Using_server-sent_events'>server-sent events (SSE) protocol</a>.
        Instead of the events being generated on the server, they originate
        from peer producers and are broadcast to all consumers. If there's no
        one else around, try opening it in another tab and talking to yourself.
      </p>

      <a href="./apps/simple_chat/" target="_blank">Open chat in tab</a>
      <div class='chat-container'></div>

      <p>
        The
        <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay.pub/tree/master/apps/simple_chat'>code</a>
        is quite simple, and most of it is just UI stuff. Here's the meat of
        it:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='javascript'>
// Send a message:

const message = JSON.stringify({
  author: "Default Nickname",
  text: "Hi there",
});

fetch('https://patchbay.pub/pubchat?pubsub=true', {
  method: 'POST',
  body: `data: ${message}\n\n`,
});


// Receive messages:

const evtSource = new EventSource("https://patchbay.pub/pubchat?mime=text%2Fevent-stream&pubsub=true&persist=true");
evtSource.onmessage = function(event) {
  console.log(event.data);
});
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        There are a couple new pieces of the patchbay API shown here. First of
        all, notice that I'm overriding the Content-Type returned from the
        server by setting mime=text/event-stream in the GET request. This is
        necessary to make the browser use the SSE protocol. The server will
        return whatever you specify. I'm also setting persist=true. This keeps
        the consumer connection open, rather than requiring it to loop after
        each message. This is useful for ensuring no messages are missed.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can also participate with curl using something like the following:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
printf 'data: {"author": "Curly Jefferson", "text": "Hi there"}\n\n' | curl https://patchbay.pub/pubchat?pubsub=true --data-binary @-
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Note that printf is necessary in order to properly pass the newlines
        to curl, and I'm using --data-binary to prevent curl from stripping
        whitespace. Also note that this chat system is very easy for
        bad actors to interfere with by sending crafted messages. A real
        solution would probably need something more sophisticated than SSE,
        including some sort of client-side filtering.
      </p>

      <h2 id='job-queues'>Poor man's job queue</h2>

      <p>
        What if you had a directory with 1000 MP3s you want to transcode
        without using more than 4 cores on your machine? You could google how
        to use GNU parallel for the 27th time (assuming it runs on your
        operating system), or you could run something like this in one
        terminal:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
#!/bin/bash

# IFS determines what to split on. By default it will split on spaces. Change
# it to newlines
# See https://www.cyberciti.biz/tips/handling-filenames-with-spaces-in-bash.html
ifsbak=$IFS
IFS=$(echo -en "\n\b")

for filename in *.mp3
do
        curl https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span> -d $filename
done

# Need to restore IFS to its previous value
IFS=$ifsbak
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        And this in 4 others:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
#!/bin/bash

while true
do
        filename=$(curl -s https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>)
        if [ "$filename" != "Too Many Requests" ]
        then
                echo $filename
                ffmpeg -i "$filename" "$filename.ogg"
        else
                sleep 1
        fi
done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        The work will be evenly distributed across the consumer workers,
        without using more than 4 cores at a time.
      </p>

      <h2 id='static-hosting'>Poor man's web hosting</h2>

      Time to get funky. This entire web site is being hosted over a
      patchbay.pub channel. How? This is essentially how I'm hosting the
      index.html for the page you're reading (note that it uses the root
      channel, /):

      <pre><code class='bash'>
while true; do curl -X POST https://patchbay.pub/ --data-binary ./index.html; done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        And chat.js:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
while true; do curl -X POST https://patchbay.pub/apps/simple_chat/chat.js --data-binary ./apps/simple_chat/chat.js; done
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        That's right; I'm advocating bash as your next web server! (that's not
        something I ever thought I'd write). This works because static site
        hosting can be modeled as a MPMC queue, where each file you want to
        host is a producer in a loop, and web browsers create a consumer with
        each request to a resource. You can also assign multiple producers to
        each hosted file for poor man's load balancing.
      </p>

      <p>
        There's nothing special about channel ids. Any valid URL path will do.
        In this case the channel ids carry extra semantic information
        corresponding to a HTTP resource location, but as far as the server is
        concerned, apps/simple_chat/chat.js is just a bunch of characters
        forming an id.
      </p>

      <p>
        Astute observers will see a problem here: what's preventing any of you
        from sending POST requests to those channels and competing with my
        producers to publish your own content in place of this page? For these
        few endpoints, I added a bit of authentication to ensure I'm the only
        one who can publish to them. In general I don't expect people to need
        publicly facing sites on patchbay.pub. I think sites hosted on
        privately shared channels (a la poor man's
        <a target='_blank' href='https://ngrok.com/'>ngrok</a>) are much more likely.
        But feel free to reach out if you want a "vanity channel" for some
        reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        Just because you can't host something on the root channel, doesn't mean
        you can't host it somewhere else on patchbay.pub. There's a
        <code>host.sh</code> script in
        <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay.pub'>the repo</a>).
        You can host your own copy of this site on your own channel by
        cloning the repo and running this command:
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
./host.sh https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        Then point your browser here (make sure to include the trailing slash;
        it's required for relative browser imports to work):
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span>/
      </code></pre>

      <p>
        You can now make whatever changes you want to the code, and they will
        immediately take effect when you refresh the browser. I actually wrote
        this page, which is a simple static HTML page, using this workflow.
        Note that you need to refresh twice, in order to flush the curl
        producers that are still blocked waiting for consumers of the old code.
      </p>

      <p>
        I'm working on a more robust
        <a target='_blank' href='https://github.com/patchbay-pub/patchbay-cli'>CLI tool</a>,
        which will turn common use cases like hosting a static site with many
        files into a one liner (rather than having to manually write something
        like host.sh yourself):
      </p>

      <pre><code class='bash'>
patchbay-cli host https://patchbay.pub/<span class='channel'>aa7cc811-d21c-42ef-92cc-a5566fa38344</span> ./dir/to/host
      </code></pre>

      <h2 id='serverless'>Poor man's serverless</h2>

      <p>
        MPMC is an elegant and useful tool, but it has some fundamental
        weaknesses. The most important is that consumers can only consume, and
        producers can only produce. It doesn't allow you to model a full
        client/server, request/response architecture, because consumers can't
        upload anything, and producers can't change their response based on
        the client's parameters. In order to handle these more complicated
        scenarios, patchbay implements a third protocol, called
        requester/responder or reqres for short.
      </p>

      <p>

        Take a gander at the following
        <a target='_blank' href='https://durian.blender.org/'>Sintel</a>
        video, which is being served over patchbay:

        <div class='video-container'>
          <video controls>
            <!--<source src="./sintel.mp4" type="video/mp4">-->
            <source src="https://patchbay.pub/videos/sintel-2048-surround.mp4" type="video/mp4">
            Sorry, your browser doesn't support embedded videos.
          </video>
        </div>

        Now observe that seeking to specific points in the video works just
        fine. If you're not familiar with HTTP streaming, this is
        accomplished using
        <a target='_blank' href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Range_requests'>HTTP range requests</a>,
        which are basically just a way for an HTTP client (your browser) to say
        to the server, "Hey, I only need these specific bytes from this really
        big file". The browser then requests the file chunks around wherever
        you currently are in the video. This is done using HTTP headers. How
        patchbay does this is beyond the scope of this intro. It requires a bit
        more work when implementing the responder (though it's a lot simpler
        than you might imagine), but it's seamless for the requester, ie your
        browser. It just requests the file segments as it normally would.

        When all is said and done, anything you can do with a normal server,
        you can do with patchbay.
      </p>

      <p>
        Ok, time to get <em>really</em> funky. Remember that patchbay is 100%
        HTTP. That means all the functionality is available in a web browser. But
        surely you couldn't host a streamable video like above from your browser?

        Use the dialog below to open a video file:

        <h1>TODO: add fibridge UI</h1>


        If you scan that QR code on your phone, you'll be able to stream the
        video just as before. But this time your browser is the responder. As
        long as you keep this tab of your browser open, you can share that link
        with friends and they can stream the video.
      </p>


      <h2 id='file-sharing'>Poor man's file sharing</h2>

      No sketchy web service is complete without the ability to share files.
      Pubsub messages are restricted in size, because each message has to be
      copied into memory in order to be broadcast.  MPMC streams are under no
      such limitation. If you POST a 10GB file and send your friend a link, it
      will be efficiently streamed from your machine, through a patchbay.pub
      server, to your friend's machine. Note that bandwidth is currently quite
      rate-limited on the free server, so I only recommend this for relatively
      small files. Otherwise you'll be waiting a while.


      <h1 id='security'>Security</h1>

      <p>
        patchbay is designed for simple ad-hoc tasks, with very low friction
        being a primary goal.  Having to juggle auth tokens and logins runs
        counter to these aims. As such, it probably shouldn't be used for any
        highly sensitive data.  That said, I think it's secure enough for many
        uses. In general, the longer and more random your channel id is, the
        less likely anyone else can guess it or stumble upon it. You'll
        probably want to user longer ids than the one generated for these
        examples. Maybe a UUID or something. Also note that due to 1) rate
        limiting and 2) the fact that requests block by default, brute forcing
        probably isn't a viable attack strategy for channel ids of even
        moderate length.
      </p>

      <h1 name='privacy'>Privacy</h1>
      <p>
        We don't look at anyone's data as it goes through our servers, but
        you can also use end-to-end encryption if you don't trust us.
      </p>

      <h1>Caveats</h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
          The goal is to keep patchbay free for everyone to use for projects of
          a reasonable size. However, it's obviously necessary to implement
          request rate and bandwidth limits. If there's enough interest, I'll
          probably spin out a product of some sort for high-load use cases.
          Feel free to reach out at

          if you have any thoughts.
        </li>
        <li>
          Due to the way TCP works, it can be tricky to detect when an HTTP
          client has disconnected. So if you connect a producer and then
          cancel it, the server might keep it around for a while before
          cleaning it up, and a consumer might grab the stale/partial data.
          The simplest way to handle these situations is to flush it manually
          by attaching a consumer as soon as you cancel the producer.
        </li>
        <li>
          In general, your code needs to assume the connection can fail at any
          time without having transferred any data. Additionally, even if some
          or all of a producer body is read from the request, that doesn't
          guarantee it's been delivered to a consumer. It might just be in an
          OS buffer. That said, the server should never close a producer
          connection until a consumer has attached and all data has been read
          from the producer.
        </li>
      </ul>
